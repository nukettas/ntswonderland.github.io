              "He's been asking about you. What's the conversation about?" Kira
              asked Sarah with an air of excitement as she skillfully concocted
              drinks for the customers. "Just casual chatter. What did he want
              to know?" Sarah responded while continuing her work. "He was
              curious if you're in a relationship or if there's something
              serious going on," Kira revealed with a certain eagerness. "He's
              quite the handsome guy, and a dentist to boot. Let's see where
              this leads. Oh my!" she exclaimed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The night flowed on, and the trio engaged in lengthy conversations
              with the dentist. His curiosity delved into Kira's personal life,
              prompting him to seek comprehensive knowledge. After four hours,
              exhaustion began to creep in on Sarah, compelling her to bid
              adieu. "I can give you a lift," he offered. "It's not far, really,
              you don't have to trouble yourself. You're still seated," Sarah
              politely countered. Yet, his persistence prevailed, and he
              insisted on accompanying her. "Just give me a moment! Allow me to
              join you; I could use a breather for about ten minutes," he
              requested. "What about the pub? Who will manage it?" Sarah
              inquired. "Ethan can handle it. It's not overly bustling right
              now." With that settled, they embarked on their departure.
            </p>
            <p>
              A fleeting melancholy expression crossed the dentist's face as he
              looked at Sarah, and soon enough, laughter enveloped them both. In
              an attempt to connect, he showcased his playlist, fostering a
              discussion about their musical preferences. However, Kira's
              chatter seemed to have no off switch. When the time came to part
              ways, his embrace was unexpectedly tight. As she left, the memory
              of that lingering hug remained with her.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next day brought a surprising text from Kira. "He's a great
              kisser," it read. Flabbergasted, Sarah responded, "Who on earth
              did you make out with? Spill the beans!" Kira's response was
              equally shocking, "The dentist. We kissed passionately for a good
              half-hour." Confusion filled Sarah's mind. "Wait, what? I thought
              it was just a casual thing, a whim. We talked, and when we kissed,
              he didn't pull away. That's all. Are you upset?" Kira retorted.
              "No, I'm actually glad you've found someone. Enjoy!" Sarah forced
              out a supportive response, concealing her feelings of betrayal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Deeply hurt, Sarah grappled with the sensation of betrayal, yet
              she found herself unable to voice her emotions.
