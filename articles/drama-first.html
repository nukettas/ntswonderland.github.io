              As she heard curses and yelling from downstairs, she tried to stay
              calm, resisting the urge to eavesdrop on their conversation.
              However, she found it impossible to ignore. She felt compelled to
              listen to every single word, ensuring that no one was getting
              hurt, while also keeping an ear out for approaching footsteps so
              she could pretend to be asleep.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the first set of footsteps passed by her room, she held her
              breath, she anxiously waited for the second. Although she couldn't
              bring herself to close her eyes, she remained alert. As soon as
              the second set of footsteps faded away, she reached for her
              headphones and immersed herself in a dream of her ideal family.
            </p>
            <p>
              In her dream, she had a peaceful, loving, and happy family. She
              imagined herself with four children who adored her and craved her
              attention. Her husband was caring, handsome, and highly respected,
              and their home was warm and secure, with sturdy doors. Together,
              they set the dinner table, with music playing softly in the
              background. They exchanged affectionate kisses on the cheek
              whenever they passed each other, creating an atmosphere of love
              and intimacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a brief dance break, the table was finally ready. Just as
              they were about to sit down with their children, her husband
              gently took her hand, looked into her eyes, and reassured her, "I
              will never hurt you." He pressed her against his chest, expressing
              his unwavering love and promising to protect her from any harm.
              Overwhelmed by his words, she drifted off to sleep, her tears
              still moist on her cheeks.
