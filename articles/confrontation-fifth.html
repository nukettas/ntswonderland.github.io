              As they sat in the living room playing Trivia with their friends,
              she felt a moment of detachment. It dawned on her that he hadn't
              contributed to any of the preparations – no help with cooking,
              cleaning, or even tidying the room. Despite asking him a couple of
              times, he always seemed preoccupied with phone calls, emails, or
              gaming. It wasn't a new behavior; she remembered instances before.
              "Lisa, Lisa, it's your turn!" the others called out, interrupting
              her thoughts. "Sorry," she smiled, "I was thinking of grabbing
              some treats. Let me fix it real quick." In reality, she just
              wanted a few moments alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              For so long, he had acted like an irresponsible teenager, she
              thought as she headed to the kitchen. He did nothing unless
              prompted – even simple tasks like cleaning the house or getting
              groceries required her to ask for help. They had stopped having
              their weekly date nights, with him often claiming to be too tired
              or sleepy. She made up her mind to talk to him about it as soon as
              they were alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              When she entered the room with an assortment of chips, chocolates,
              and nuts, everyone cheered for her. Throughout the night, she
              continued to wear a smile, despite feeling hurt.
            </p>
