              I was at my grandmother's summer house. It was a family gathering,
              everyone was there, my uncles and aunties, my cousins. Being
              around six years old, there were noticeable age differences
              between me and my cousins, yet we were all quite young. The
              atmosphere took a turn when disagreements arose among the adults
              over something I can't recall now.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was clear, even to us youngsters, that something wasn't right.
              In an attempt to shield us from the escalating conflict, my
              grandmother decided to take me and my cousins to another location.
              Despite our tender age, we understood the tension in the air.
              Silently, we walked alongside my grandmother, our emotions
              threatening to overwhelm us. Remarkably, my grandmother didn't
              press us to talk; instead, she shared in our solemn silence. On
              that particular day, there was a warning of rough seas, but my
              grandmother chose to take us to the beach regardless. As we
              approached the shore after about a 20-minute walk, an empty
              stretch of sand greeted us.
            </p>
            <p>
              I remember that my grandmother stood in front of us and said, now
              we are going to learn how not to fall. We held hands together,
              walked into the sea. We fought with waves, we choked sometimes, we
              fell but we laughed at the end of it. I remember that my
              grandmother was also laughing with us, she was like one of us that
              day, she was like our friend. That was the date that I knew I had
              to be a fighter if I wanted to laugh.
