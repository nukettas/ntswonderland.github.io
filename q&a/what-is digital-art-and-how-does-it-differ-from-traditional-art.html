            <p>
              Digital art is a creative form of expression that uses digital technology to produce <a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/NTsWonderland/">visual</a>  or multimedia artwork. It's like painting or drawing, but on a computer or a graphic tablet, using special software designed for artists.
              So, it's like painting on a computer?   
              Exactly! Digital artists use tools like digital brushes and pens on a computer screen or tablet. They can create everything from digital paintings and illustrations to 3D models and animations. The possibilities are quite diverse.           
            </p>
            <br />
            <br>
            <p>
              How does that differ from traditional art?
Traditional art, on the other hand, involves using physical materials like paint, ink, or sculptural materials. Artists work on real canvases, paper, or other surfaces. So, instead of a digital brush, they'd use a physical paintbrush or charcoal.
<br>
<br>
<p>Are there any other differences?
  Certainly! One key difference is the ease of editing. In digital art, you can easily undo or redo your work, try out different colors, and add special effects. It's very forgiving. In traditional art, once you've made a mark, it's there to stay. There's less room for experimentation.
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <p>Another significant difference is in distribution. Digital art can be instantly shared and distributed online. You can post it on social media, <a href="https://ntswonderland.myshopify.com/">sell prints</a>, or showcase it on your <a href="../index.html"> website</a>, making it accessible to a global audience. Traditional art often requires physical exhibitions or galleries for exposure.
    How about the tactile experience?
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Ah, yes, that's a unique aspect of traditional art. In traditional art, you have a direct connection with the medium. You feel the texture of the canvas or paper, the weight of the brush, or the sculpting process. It's a hands-on experience that's often cherished by artists.
    </p>
    <br>
              <br />
              <p>So, if I had to sum it up;
                In a nutshell, digital art relies on digital tools, is easily editable, and can be distributed online. Traditional art, on the other hand, involves physical materials, offers a direct tactile connection, and results in unique, one-of-a-kind physical objects.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>To summarize:
                </p>
                <br>
              <strong>Digital Art:</strong> <br>
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Digital art is created using digital tools and technology such as computers, graphic tablets, and software like Adobe Photoshop, Corel Painter, or digital illustration apps.
              <br />
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Artists use digital brushes, pens, and other tools to create their artwork directly on a computer screen or graphic tablet.
              <br />
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> It offers a wide range of possibilities, from digital painting and illustration to 3D modeling, animation, and multimedia art.
              <br />
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> The digital format allows for easy editing, layering, and the use of special effects.
              <br />
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Digital art can be shared and distributed online, making it accessible to a global audience.
              <br />
              <strong>Traditional Art:</strong> <br>
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Traditional art encompasses various physical media such as painting, drawing, sculpture, and more.
              <br />
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Artists work with materials like oil paints, watercolors, charcoal, ink, and physical canvases, paper, or sculptural materials.
              <br />
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> It often requires a deep understanding of techniques and materials, such as mixing paints or sculpting with clay.
              <br />
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Traditional art is tactile and allows for a direct connection between the artist's hand and the medium.
              <br />
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Artworks are typically one-of-a-kind physical objects, which can be displayed in galleries or private collections.
              <br />
              <strong>Differences:
              </strong> <br>
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Tools: Digital art relies on digital devices and software, while traditional art uses physical tools and materials.

              <br />
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Editing: Digital art is easily editable and reversible, allowing artists to experiment without consequences. Traditional art is less forgiving, often requiring a more planned approach.

              <br />
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Distribution: Digital art can be instantly shared online, while traditional art may require physical exhibitions for exposure.

              <br />
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Tactility: Traditional art offers a tangible connection between the artist and the medium, which can be absent in digital art.

              <br />
              <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Originality: Each traditional artwork is a unique physical object, while digital art can be easily reproduced.

              <br />
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In summary, digital art and traditional art are distinct in terms of the tools and techniques used, the creative process, and the nature of the final artwork. Digital art offers a wide range of possibilities and accessibility, while traditional art retains its uniqueness and tactile nature. It's all about artistic expression!
