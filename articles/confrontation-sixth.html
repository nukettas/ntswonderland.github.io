              When they were talking with her boyfriend about how they would
              raise a baby together, she couldn't help Herself but wondered how
              she would be if some lovely non alcoholic couple would raise her.
              Would she be getting that cello class she always wanted when she
              was 13. She remembered her fathers response when she asked if she
              could try that. He said that his dream was getting a helicopter so
              not everybody's dream would come true. Then she remembered, wasn't
              he the one who took piano lessons a couple months after she asked
              for that class.
            </p>
            <p>
              When she was drawing clothes just for herself, butterfly dress,
              and pink cute pants with flower, when she told her mom that she
              wanted to become a designer and wanted to live in Spain doesn't
              she the one who told her no designer make money unless she is a
              very talented, and with a smug smile on her face throw the paper
              of her designs when she was only 11.
            </p>
            <p>
              When she hit 17 and loved to be a Baker and open up her coffee
              shop, wasn't her mom told her if she became a Baker she would end
              up broke. Then she remembered the time when she learned how to
              write when she was in kindergarten and they hung her shirt story
              on the wall about how proud she was. And a couple months later
              when her father finds one of her stories and ripped it off while
              he was drunk. What could she become if someone else, even with
              slightly different parents, raised her. Maybe she has more self
              esteem who knows maybe she would even own a coffee shop that she
              always wanted.
