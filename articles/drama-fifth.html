            <p>
              As soon as she woke up and saw his boyfriend lying next to her,
              she felt the sadness as she felt every night for 3 months. They
              become more and more distant over time. They were having fights as
              soon as they started to talk. “Before I get into those depressing
              thoughts I should just start studying” she thought and got up,
              made her morning coffee, turned on her computer and checked her
              emails. “Oh he must have forgotten to close his account on my
              computer”, since his phone has broken, he was using her computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              She saw that the instagram was still open. She felt this urge to
              check his DM’s. She fought for a couple of minutes but she
              couldn't help herself and started to dig in. She saw that message
              sent by his “best friend”. “What are we going to do now? How are
              we going to talk?” She read it 3 times, and couldn't make any
              sense. “Why was this woman so anxious about talking with my
              boyfriend?” she asked. And why the hell on earth the only deleted
              messages were from that woman? There were no previous messages,
              only those few sentences.
            </p>
            <p>
              She felt the anger and anxiety on her head. Her eyes started
              twitching. Now she was thinking about digging into his whatsapp
              also. She was about to ruin every single stand in their
              relationship, the personal space, boundaries. She wasn't thinking
              clearly of course, and she tried to use the whatsapp web and there
              it was all the messages. But again only a few sentences from her,
              other texts were there. “Why was he deleting the conversations?”
              She rushed into the bed, woke him up and it was what she hoped not
              to. He was cheating for two fucking months with his best friend.
              She packed her bag, took a few things and left the house that once
              she felt secure, safe, peaceful.
