            <p>
              While cutting her own hair in the bathroom, she found herself
              engrossed in a series of introspective questions. Thoughts like
              "When did she arrive in Canada? How long had it been since she
              last saw her best friend get drunk with her? Has she changed much
              since they last saw her?" flooded her mind with each snip of the
              scissors. She was trimming the back of her hair when she abruptly
              stopped because she had noticed those worn yet hopeful eyes, which
              lacked sparkle. Despite her dissatisfaction with her reflection,
              she proved she can handle everything on her own. In the mirror,
              she sees tiredness and pride. Although she felt helpless, she was
              actually happy. She had even managed to cut her own hair—an
              accomplishment worth celebrating, considering it was always a
              hairdresser cutting her hair, a nail artist who does her nails, a
              driver who picks her up and drops her off.It was undeniably a
              proud moment, even though she had made a mess of the back of her
              hair.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, she stood in front of the mirror, observing herself with a
              broad smile, despite the absurdity of her hair. It dawned on her
              at that very moment that she had never truly been alone. She
              realized that she had always had a boyfriend, never letting a
              month pass without some form of romantic entanglement. A
              disconcerting thought immediately nagged at her: "Had she been
              molding her personality to fit the desires of each man who entered
              her life? Was she just a copycat? Then who was she truly? What was
              her authentic style?" She had never experienced loneliness, as
              someone always came and went. Despite the fact that she had found
              comfort in this situation, she questioned her genuine happiness.
              Was she really satisfied or simply letting things go? By allowing
              any man who expressed interest to become a part of her life, was
              she genuinely happy?
            </p>
            <p>
              As she cleaned the sink, the scissors, and the floor, she hoped
              for the best while preparing herself for the worst.
