              It was an idyllic day for their long-awaited reunion. The clock
              ticked towards 3 pm, marking the start of her work shift, while
              the heavens smiled down with a radiant sun after an extended spell
              of rain. The embracing warmth of sunny days had finally returned.
              Sam's call inviting her for a leisurely stroll and an Irish coffee
              was too enticing to resist. The prospect of reconnecting after
              months filled her with eager anticipation.
            </p>
            <p>
              As she readied herself, thoughts of the three-month gap since
              their last meeting crossed her mind, which she shared with her
              boyfriend while preparing. Adorning her work attire, she added
              delicate jewelry that caught the light just right, dabbed her
              favored perfume, and applied a touch of makeup to enhance her
              features. Fully prepared, she left her abode, a vision of poise
              and confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their rendezvous point was set for 11 am, at the bustling
              intersection of Bloor and Bay. Punctuality was her hallmark, and
              she arrived precisely at 10:50. However, as the hands of the clock
              marched on to 11:35, she couldn't help but entertain thoughts of
              the inconsiderateness of keeping someone waiting. At long last,
              Sam emerged, expressing his apologies and explaining that work had
              held him hostage in conversations and engagements. Suppressing any
              frustration, she graced him with a smile, and they mutually agreed
              to embark on their coffee outing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their exchange initially revolved around their professional lives,
              but soon took an unexpected turn. Sam's inquiry into her earnings
              and the challenges of sustaining life in Toronto caught her off
              guard. The topic was an unwelcome departure from her anticipated
              conversation. A sense of unease began to pervade her. "Becoming a
              bartender at a local pub might yield more than your current role,"
              Sam suggested, recounting anecdotes of a friend who had held a
              similar job. He proceeded to describe her, his eyes lingering in a
              way that made Kira feel uneasy. The conversation veered into
              displaying photos and tactless body shaming remarks about Kira.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the coffee shop interaction drew to a close, Kira felt
              emotionally wounded and vulnerable. Stepping outside, she grappled
              with a surge of self-doubt. The sharp words Sam had casually
              uttered had taken root, prompting her to question her own
              perception of her beauty and worth.
