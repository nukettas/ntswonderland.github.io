              "He's ticking all the right boxes," she exclaimed, her smile
              lighting up the room. Sarah felt a wave of relief wash over her as
              her friend delivered those words. They were deep in conversation
              about a man she had recently crossed paths with, a mere seven
              weeks ago. After a series of disappointing dates, this new person
              had brought genuine happiness into her life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike the others, he had taken the initiative to ask her out on a
              proper date. With thoughtfulness, he had selected the venue, a
              local pub where he expressed his desire to simply be in her
              company. "Just being around you," he had admitted that night, his
              smile offering a reassuring comfort.
              <br />
              He had disclosed his upcoming three-week trip with her buddy,
              ensuring that their second date would align just before his
              departure. Even while away, he maintained regular contact, sending
              her messages three or four times a week. These messages held a
              reassuring quality that eased Sarah's underlying fears.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet, amidst the green flags waving before her, Sarah couldn't
              shake a growing sense of unease. Deep down, she acknowledged that
              perfection was elusive in life. Even his promise to cook for her
              upon his return seemed too good to be true. Her trepidation
              remained undefined, though its weight was undeniable. The day's
              cheesecake was shared with Kira, concluding their time together.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two days later, they found themselves cooking side by side,
              accompanied by wine, laughter, and a touch of tipsiness. Amidst
              the playful atmosphere, their connection grew, and the night ended
              with tender kisses scattered across cheeks, chin, nose, and
              forehead. Sarah's heart raced, her emotions dancing to a fervent
              rhythm. As the days ticked by, nine sunsets later, a message
              arrived, commencing with an apology. The weight of uncertainty
              settled upon her chest as she read those words. Swamped with work,
              she couldn't dedicate her full attention to the message, but a
              quick glance revealed its essence. She replied with a gentle "no
              worries :)," her heart heavy with a growing sensation she couldn't
              grasp. The message conveyed gratitude for shared moments, yet
              offered no explanation or reason. The whys remained elusive, and
              Sarah felt drained, as though she had been awake for two days
              straight. Nonetheless, she soldiered on, burying herself in work
              despite the fatigue that clung to her.
