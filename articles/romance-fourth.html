              When she read the text, she couldn't believe her eyes at first.
              She read it over 7 times. “I am in your town :)” She was feeling
              nauseated, and didn't know what to think or how to feel.She was
              just about to get that important exam in 45 minutes to not go to
              summer class and retake the class. She was trying to calm herself,
              this exam was too important to blow up for her. She decided to
              call her mom and asked about her opinion. When she told her mom
              about the text, she said “I cannot tell you what to do or what not
              to do my love but please follow your heart and don't forget how
              hard it was to get over him for you”. She was shaking, her whole
              body was shaking.
            </p>
            <p>
              She was already in the classroom, just sitting by herself and
              trying to focus on the subjects. She opened up her notes, and
              started to read them, finally took the exam and went straight to
              her house. She was so confused. She waited for him for one and
              half years. She cried, had nightmares, tried to go to his country,
              canceled her flights several times, got drunk, and cried again.
            </p>
            <p>
              When she realized they would never meet again and his love was
              over, she tried to go back in life, she partly did it and after
              one and half fucking years later, decided to give a chance to that
              sweet guy.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Why now, why did you choose to come into my life when I decided
              to move on?” she asked when she was crying under the pressure of
              mixed feelings while she was sitting in her bed and reading the
              message again. She was feeling the same things again but this time
              she felt the fear, she couldn't do this to herself again, cannot
              let herself go into that dark place ever again.
