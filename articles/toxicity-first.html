              She was as high as the sky. They were sitting on their balcony
              with her boyfriend, just listening to some chill music. She just
              wanted to feel nothing that day, not feeling the weight of that
              rumor at her work, doesn't want to feel the humiliation that she
              had never experienced in her life, doesn't want to feel the
              disappointment that she experienced today.
            </p>
            <p>
              She felt abused, she felt hurted so much, she could even feel the
              pain in her body. Her brain shut down itself after she heard the
              saying.She slept through the whole day. But she was awake again.
              She was a good employer she knew, she was getting the job done
              before even her senior. Just a couple of months ago, they moved in
              together with her boyfriend. It was a 1 bedroom, with a little
              balcony. They build this life together. She doesn't even remember
              when was the last time she felt that happy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today though, she remembered the things that she buried a long
              time ago. But now she remembers that feeling, that pain in her
              body. She knew that feeling, that abused feeling, it was so funny
              how our brain works she thought. She suddenly remembered the
              incident, it was that summer, when she felt the public humiliation
              for the first time in her life. When she was screaming to her
              father to stop, and no one was coming to help them. Once she
              stepped outside everyone was there, just listening to the scream
              of the 13 year old girl and the mother. And again, she felt the
              same humiliation, desperation. Only difference this time there was
              someone with her, she wasn't screaming but there he was, she
              wasn't alone anymore, there was someone to hold her hand, telling
              her that everything is going to be okay.
