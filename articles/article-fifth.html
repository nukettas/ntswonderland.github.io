              While strolling through the park, her mind churned with a single
              question: what had happened to him? Her feet led her to the bench
              where they had once shared a four-and-a-half-hour conversation on
              their first date. A surge of nostalgia overcame her, and she
              settled onto the bench, memories flooding back. In those moments,
              he had spoken passionately about his dreams and his endeavors,
              recounting how he assisted migrants struggling with English. His
              eyes had radiated with enthusiasm, often locking onto her as he
              lost himself in the conversation. "It hasn't been that long, only
              six months. What could have transpired to make him transform so
              drastically?" she mused aloud.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recollections of their incredible summer together rushed through
              her mind. From a spirited three-day camping escapade at a music
              festival to exploring new local eateries weekly, their shared
              experiences seemed to form a seamless connection. They even took
              the step of joining a gym as a united front. In her eyes, their
              relationship had been an embodiment of perfection. Thoughtful
              gestures like weekly flowers and presents were emblematic of his
              devotion. He had even spoken of moving in together the following
              year, just four months into their journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the current month had proven to be a discordant note in
              their symphony. He began to evade her calls, responding only by
              the end of the day. His once rapt attention waned, and during a
              coffee shop outing, he had devoted an entire hour to his phone,
              barely acknowledging her presence. Even when she sought to engage
              him, his response was a distant nod. A pervasive fragility seemed
              to cloak their interactions, where even lighthearted jests
              triggered his ire. She perceived the growing chasm in his gaze, a
              space that held words left unsaid.
            </p>
            <p>
              As she contemplated her course of action, a resolute decision
              formed. She yearned for answers, a reason for this unraveling
              spectacle. With determination in her heart, she knew what she must
              do. And so, in that moment, amidst the rustling leaves and
              tranquil park, she reached for her phone and dialed his number,
              intent on uncovering the truth.
