            <p>
              Today, she woke up in a bad mood. Even though it was the beginning
              of the day, she felt tired. Her back was sore, and her eyes felt
              heavy. She sat up but couldn't find the strength to get out of
              bed, so she rolled back under the covers. Thankfully, it was her
              day off, with no work, nowhere to go, and nothing to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              As usual, her thoughts started racing as soon as she woke up, but
              this time they were particularly distressing. "It's not even 10
              a.m., please leave me alone," she pleaded with herself.
              Unfortunately, it didn't help. Her mind kept replaying terrible
              memories involving her friends and family. She felt numb and
              couldn't even move to turn her left side. "Why are you doing this
              to me?" she wondered, trying to grasp what triggered these
              feelings today, but she couldn't find a reason.
            </p>
            <p>
              She knew her mind was always talking to her, nonstop. But at least
              it could have waited until the end of the day to remind her of
              those memories, not at 10 freaking a.m.! She wasn't quite asleep,
              yet she wasn't fully awake either. Suddenly, her phone rang—it was
              her long-distance boyfriend. She didn't even try to fake a smile
              as they started talking because she lacked the energy to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              When he didn't notice how depressed she was during their
              conversation and didn't ask why she was still in bed or why she
              looked so down today (she knew she looked terrible, for sure), she
              felt strange. After they hung up, she felt even more tension on
              her shoulders. Nobody, not even the most trustworthy and connected
              person she had ever known, could tell that something was wrong.
              She had never felt so exhausted, alone, and unheard. Under the
              weight of it all, her eyes surrendered to the pressure, and she
              quickly fell asleep.
