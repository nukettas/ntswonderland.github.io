              "We really should warn her. It's an outright pyramid scheme!" one
              friend asserted. The other replied, skepticism in their voice,
              "You think so?" The first friend continued earnestly, "Absolutely!
              They're peddling these supposed 'domain names' that are nothing
              more than empty web pages. Then, you're supposed to sell these
              empty sites to others, and if those folks start selling, you get a
              cut. It's a chain, a trap!"
            </p>
            <p>
              "But do you reckon she'll believe us?" the second friend pondered.
              The first friend replied confidently, "We're her friends, after
              all. Why wouldn't she?" "Hey, I was just about to call you both.
              There's a team meeting at 3 pm. Let's go together. I want you to
              meet the whole crew," Chris chimed in. "Actually, we need to talk
              about that," one of the friends interjected, a tone of seriousness
              in their voice.
            </p>
            <p>
              They proceeded to lay out all the information they had to Chris,
              explaining the scheme as best they could. Despite the warning,
              Chris decided to attend the meeting anyway. Thirty minutes later,
              Sena's phone rang. "Hey, Chris, what's going on?" Sena inquired.
              "I'm at Franks. Care to join me?" Chris responded. "Yeah, we'll be
              there in about 15 minutes," Sena confirmed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arriving at the coffee shop, they found Chris sitting at a table
              surrounded by nearly 15 people, two empty chairs conspicuously
              placed in the center. It felt like a setup. They approached,
              casting wary glances at the gathering. The atmosphere was tense,
              like a looming guillotine.
            </p>
            <p>
              As they took their seats, a tense conversation ensued. They cast
              doubt on the legitimacy of the business, deeming it a scheme.
              Chris, however, staunchly defended it. The situation escalated,
              taking a menacing turn. Threats of legal action were flung, a
              sword of Damocles over their heads, should they persist in
              "slandering" the business.
