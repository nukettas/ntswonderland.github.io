              "And here we go again," she said, realizing that in three days she
              would turn 26. She already knew the plan - she would be waiting at
              home for her friends. When they arrived with balloons and cake,
              she would pretend to be surprised, spend the evening together, and
              wash the dishes afterward. She appreciated this small, thoughtful
              gesture. Despite telling everyone that she didn't like celebrating
              her birthday, that was actually a lie.
            </p>

              She still remembers the disappointment she felt two years ago when
              she expected a grand celebration from her boyfriend. They had
              talked about getting married, and she anticipated grand gestures
              from him. Meanwhile, she had put in a lot of effort to make him
              happy. But all she got was a kiss. "I didn't buy a cake because
              you don't like it, but if you want, we can go and eat some
              cheesecake," he said. She tried to hide her sadness and pretended
              that everything was fine since it was a football night after all.
              She let it pass that year.
            </p>

              The following year, she got so drunk on her birthday that she
              decided to call her brother and share the song that was playing,
              as it reminded her of their childhood and was his favorite song.
              After three minutes of yelling and asking why she called since
              they talked in the morning, he abruptly hung up. She was confused
              because she couldn't even understand the reason for his anger, let
              alone ask about it. That year, she cried and made the decision to
              stop celebrating her birthday altogether.
